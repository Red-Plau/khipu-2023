A Hands-On Forecasting Guide: From Theory to Practice

> Forecasting, the prediction of future events from past data, is central to decision-making in virtually all technical domains. For instance, predicting product sales in retail, forecasting energy demand, or anticipating customer churn, all have tremendous value across different industries. However, the landscape of forecasting techniques is as diverse as it is useful, and different techniques and expertise are adapted to different types and sizes of data.
>
> In this hands-on workshop led by experts from Tryolabs and Google, we give an overview of forecasting concepts, methods, and practical applications on the M5 forecasting challenge. In the context of forecasting, weâ€™ll walk you through the data exploration, data preparation, feature engineering, statistical (e.g., STL, ARIMA) and machine learning (e.g., decision forests) modeling, meta-modeling (e.g., hierarchical and relational modeling, ensembles, resource models), and how to safely evaluate such temporal models.
>
> We conclude the session with a discussion and a list of reading materials to learn more about forecasting. Join us for a fun and interactive workshop hosted by Tryolabs and Google!
